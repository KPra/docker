Docker
-------

Docker is an open source computer program developed by Solomon Hykes, which was initially started as an internal project within dotCloud, a PAAS company.
It was built on dotCloud's proprietary technology, which is itself built on earlier open-source projects such as Cloudlets.
It was released in March 2013.

Docker is an operating system level virtualization also known as containerization software.
OS level virtualization is where the kernel allows for the existence of multiple user space instances known as containers/partitions/jails/virtual environments,
where the programs running inside them consider them as full fledged computer environments.
These programs can only see the containers contents and resources allocated to the container.

It is primarily built for Linux, where it uses the features of the kernel to isolate the containers, which avoids the overhead of running VMs.
Since version 0.9, Docker includes the libcontainer library as its own way to directly use virtualization facilities provided by the Linux kernel.
Docker containers do not include a seperate OS.
	- cgroups - for resource management in terms of CPU and memory
	- namespaces - for isolation in terms of what can be seen by the containers as part of the OS environment like
			process trees
			mounted devices
			user groups
			network
			peripheral devices
			file systems

Docker makes it really easy to install and run software without worrying about dependencies or setup.
Docker is an ecosystem which revolves around creating/deploying/managing containers.

Docker image - is a single file with all the program configs, dependencies
Docker container - is an instance of an image, running representation of a docker image with its own set of hardware resources
